   - create-id-with-trailing-garbage: Attempts to create a plugin instance using an existing plugin ID with some extra text appended
       to the end. This should return a null pointer.
     SKIPPED: The plugin library does not expose any plugins

   - preset-discovery-crawl: If the plugin supports the preset discovery mechanism, then this test ensures that all of the plugin's
       declared locations can be indexed successfully.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.preset-discovery-factory/draft-2' factory.

   - preset-discovery-descriptor-consistency: Ensures that all preset provider descriptors from a preset discovery factory match
       those stored in the providers created by the factory.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.preset-discovery-factory/draft-2' factory.

   - preset-discovery-load: The same as 'preset-discovery-crawl', but also tries to load all found presets for plugins supported the
       CLAP plugin library. A single plugin instance is reused for loading multiple presets, and the process function is called after
       loading each preset.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.preset-discovery-factory/draft-2' factory.

TODO: Complete "real implementation" items:

1. In src/goclap/hostinfo.go: Create C wrapper functions for host callback integration
   - Multiple instances found where C wrappers need to be created

2. In src/goclap/plugin.go: Implement complete version of simplified code
   - Likely related to event handling or plugin initialization

3. In src/c/plugin.c: Implement shared library loading for Go code
   - Need to implement proper loading of the Go shared library

4. In src/c/plugin.c: Implement proper memory management for descriptors
   - Need to add code to free each descriptor

5. In src/c/plugin.c: Implement Go function calls via CGO
   - Multiple instances found where CGO integration is needed for various plugin operations

6. In examples/gain-with-gui/gui_bridge.cpp: Implement Qt/QML GUI initialization
   - Complete the GUI initialization code for the gain-with-gui example
