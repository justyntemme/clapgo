 Let's review areas where the example application has to do the heavy lifting that should be done via the library. We want to    │
│   provide a nice developer experience that abstracts the complicated C translations and allow the plugin. Create a markdown file  │

│   to implement in the code base. don't start implementing the changes just yet util i review your implementation strategy
