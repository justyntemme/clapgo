Plugin library tests:

 - /home/user/.clap/gain.clap

   - create-id-with-trailing-garbage: Attempts to create a plugin instance using
       an existing plugin ID with some extra text appended to the end. This
       should return a null pointer.
     PASSED

   - preset-discovery-crawl: If the plugin supports the preset discovery
       mechanism, then this test ensures that all of the plugin's declared
       locations can be indexed successfully.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.preset-discovery-factory/
       draft-2' factory.

   - preset-discovery-descriptor-consistency: Ensures that all preset provider
       descriptors from a preset discovery factory match those stored in the
       providers created by the factory.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.preset-discovery-factory/
       draft-2' factory.

   - preset-discovery-load: The same as 'preset-discovery-crawl', but also tries
       to load all found presets for plugins supported the CLAP plugin library.
       A single plugin instance is reused for loading multiple presets, and the
       process function is called after loading each preset.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.preset-discovery-factory/
       draft-2' factory.

   - query-factory-nonexistent: Tries to query a factory from the plugin's entry
       point with a non-existent ID. This should return a null pointer.
     PASSED

   - scan-rtld-now: Checks whether the plugin loads correctly when loaded using
       'dlopen(..., RTLD_LOCAL | RTLD_NOW)'. Only run on Unix-like platforms.
     PASSED

   - scan-time: Checks whether the plugin can be scanned in under 100
       milliseconds.
     PASSED: The plugin can be scanned in 11 milliseconds.

Plugin tests:

 - com.clapgo.gain

   - descriptor-consistency: The plugin descriptor returned from the plugin
       factory and the plugin descriptor stored on the 'clap_plugin object
       should be equivalent.
     PASSED

   - features-categories: The plugin needs to have at least one of the main CLAP
       category features.
     PASSED

   - features-duplicates: The plugin's features array should not contain any
       duplicates.
     PASSED

   - param-conversions: Asserts that value to string and string to value
       conversions are supported for ether all or none of the plugin's
       parameters, and that conversions between values and strings roundtrip
       consistently.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.params' extension.

   - param-fuzz-basic: Generates 50 sets of random parameter values, sets those
       on the plugin, and has the plugin process 5 buffers of random audio
       and note events. The plugin passes the test if it doesn't produce any
       infinite or NaN values, and doesn't crash.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.params' extension.

   - param-set-wrong-namespace: Sends events to the plugin with the
       'CLAP_EVENT_PARAM_VALUE' event tyep but with a mismatching namespace ID.
       Asserts that the plugin's parameter values don't change.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.params' extension.

   - process-audio-out-of-place-basic: Processes random audio through the plugin
       with its default parameter values and tests whether the output does
       not contain any non-finite or subnormal values. Uses out-of-place audio
       processing.
     PASSED

   - process-note-inconsistent: Sends intentionally inconsistent and mismatching
       note and MIDI events to the plugin with its default parameter values and
       tests the output for consistency. Uses out-of-place audio processing.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.note-ports' extension.

   - process-note-out-of-place-basic: Sends audio and random note and MIDI
       events to the plugin with its default parameter values and tests the
       output for consistency. Uses out-of-place audio processing.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.note-ports' extension.

   - state-buffered-streams: Performs the same state and parameter
       reproducibility check as in 'state-reproducibility-basic', but this time
       the plugin is only allowed to read a small prime number of bytes at a
       time when reloading and resaving the state.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.params' extension.

   - state-invalid: The plugin should return false when
       'clap_plugin_state::load()' is called with an empty state.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.state' extension.

   - state-reproducibility-basic: Randomizes a plugin's parameters, saves its
       state, recreates the plugin instance, reloads the state, and then checks
       whether the parameter values are the same and whether saving the state
       once more results in the same state file as before. The parameter values
       are updated using the process function.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.params' extension.

   - state-reproducibility-flush: Randomizes a plugin's parameters, saves
       its state, recreates the plugin instance, sets the same parameters as
       before, saves the state again, and then asserts that the two states
       are identical. The parameter values are set updated using the process
       function to create the first state, and using the flush function to
       create the second state.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.params' extension.

   - state-reproducibility-null-cookies: The exact same test as state-
       reproducibility-basic, but with all cookies in the parameter events set
       to null pointers. The plugin should handle this in the same way as the
       other test case.
     SKIPPED: The plugin does not implement the 'clap.params' extension.
