## üßπ Post-Implementation: Code Deduplication

After completing the remaining CLAP functionality, review example projects for duplicate code that could be abstracted into helper functions in the `pkg/` library:

### Areas to Review:
1. **Parameter Management Boilerplate**
   - Common parameter creation patterns
   - Standard parameter ranges and defaults
   - Parameter update handling

2. **Event Processing Patterns**
   - Common event handling loops
   - Note processing utilities
   - MIDI CC handling

3. **State Management**
   - JSON serialization/deserialization helpers
   - Common state structures
   - Version migration utilities

4. **Audio Processing Utilities**
   - Buffer management helpers
   - Common DSP operations
   - Channel routing utilities

5. **Extension Boilerplate**
   - Common extension registration patterns
   - Default extension implementations
   - Extension capability helpers

### Goals:
- Reduce cognitive load for plugin developers
- Provide sensible defaults while maintaining flexibility
- Create reusable components without hiding CLAP concepts
- Maintain zero-allocation guarantees in processing paths

## Development Guidelines

1. **Maintain Zero-Allocation Design**: All real-time paths must be allocation-free
2. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use existing extension implementations as reference
3. **Complete Features Only**: No placeholders or partial implementations
4. **Thread Safety**: All shared state must be properly synchronized
5. **Example Usage**: Each extension should have example usage in gain or synth plugins


### Next Phase
After doing all of this work we will begin the next phase that improves the codebase usability.
1. Document the makefille and it's build systems. All of the linking is confusing and we need to specify how each modules gets built, where, why, and how.
2. Document where the library could improve itself by hiding underlying C code without sacrificing the need to keep exported functions in the example project in order to allow the proper function handlers to work correctly calling the Go code
3. Review the state of the go-generate compabilities that should help a developer create a new plugin. I want to erase the last effort to do this and restart fresh. i first want to create a new markdown file to discuss this strategy, as i want to review all plugin types to ensure we have enough templates to cover use cases. in the end if someone chooses to generate a new gain plugin using our system. the output should be identifical to the example gain plugin we currently have in the examples/ directory. But first we need to discuss implementation strategy after deleting the old system. we need to think how to make this usable for go developers
