# Changes Summary

We've successfully implemented a robust solution to the plugin discovery problem in ClapGo by:

1. Implementing a JSON-C based manifest system that provides a reliable way to discover plugins
2. Ensuring plugins can be validated with the clap-validator tool
3. Fixing the fundamental architectural issue where Go plugins couldn't be found by the C bridge

## Key Changes

1. **Manifest Format**: Created a JSON manifest format that describes all plugin metadata:
   - Basic plugin information (ID, name, vendor, version)
   - Features list
   - Build information (shared library path, entry point)
   - Extensions supported
   - Parameters

2. **json-c Integration**: 
   - Replaced custom JSON parsing code with the standard json-c library
   - Enhanced error checking and robustness in JSON parsing
   - Implemented proper memory management for JSON objects

3. **Plugin Discovery**:
   - Added multiple search paths for manifest files:
     - Plugin's build directory
     - Central manifest repository (~/.clap/manifests/)
   - Implemented a fallback mechanism that looks for manifests when the Go registry is empty
   - Added detailed logging to help troubleshoot discovery issues

4. **Build System**:
   - Updated the Makefile to copy manifest files to the appropriate locations
   - Added json-c as a dependency and updated the build flags
   - Ensured plugin manifests are available at runtime

## Results

- Both example plugins (gain and synth) now pass all applicable clap-validator tests
- The system correctly loads plugin metadata from manifest files when the Go registry is empty
- The implementation is robust against missing or invalid manifest files
- The architecture now supports proper plugin discovery without requiring plugin registration in the Go runtime

## Future Work

1. **Schema Validation**: Add proper JSON schema validation for manifest files
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching for manifest parsing
3. **Feature Extensions**: Add support for more plugin features and parameters in the manifest format
4. **User Experience**: Create tools to generate and validate manifest files automatically

This solution maintains compatibility with the existing codebase while resolving the fundamental issue of plugin discovery across different Go runtimes.
